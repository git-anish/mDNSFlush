# mDNSrestart for Odysseyra1n!


MDNSFlush was [originally created by nathanaccidentally](https://github.com/nathanaccidentally/mDNSFlush) for flushing the ```mDNSResponder``` and ```discoverd``` cache so that you shouldn't run into any issues with network dropping/disconnecting.

I've modified it as a fix [for this LetMeBlock issue](https://github.com/PoomSmart/LetMeBlock/issues/15) on Odysseyra1n

You should be able to compile this quite easily and run it on your device.

**If you don't want to implement mDNSFlush directly into your tweak, you can add it as a dependency.**

**Changelog v1.0:**

1. Initial release
